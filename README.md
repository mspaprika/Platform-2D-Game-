## Cat & Fleas / 2D Platform Game
* **PLATFORM**: Windows
* **LANGUAGE**: C++
* **ENVIRONMENT**: Visual Studio
<br>
My first Platformer game, currently in progress. 
<br>
<br>
🐈 The main character is a cat and she likes to jump. 
<br>
🦟 Fleas are not friends. They sneak around and jump when you least expect it.
<br>
⛔ Cat doesn't like fleas.
<br>
💦 Water might be deadly.
<br>
**More Info soon...**
